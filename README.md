# web_proj

The project can be run by hosting a simple server. 

Server can be hosted by running the command in python:

- 3: python -m http.server

Once the server is hosted, open a web browser and type "Localhost:8000" in the search bar. Then navigate to build\web to start the web app.

You can login into the web app using the following credentials:

## MySQL Connectivity

The database is online so that all of us can use it and removes the redundant work that each of us would do. Once you do git pull, run "flutter pub get" into your project directory.
